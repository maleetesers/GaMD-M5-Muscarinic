# GaMD-M5-muscarinic
Gaussian MD simulation scripts and PDB files used in my project, "Exploring the conformations of the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor."

**Descriptions:**
- 1_membrane-equilibration
> Contains scripts and parameters from *CHARMM GUI Membrane BUilder* to equilibrate the protein-membrane system
- 2_cMD-production
> Contains scripts for conventional MD simulations (100 ns).
- 3_GaMD-optimization
> Contains scripts for the optimization step of Gaussian MD simulations.
- 4_GaMD-equilibration
> Contains scripts for the equilibration steps of Gaussian MD simulations (50 ns).
- 5_GaMD-production
> Contains scripts and notes for the production steps of Gaussian MD simulations (200 ns).
- GaMD-optimization-results
> Contains log files where the acceleration level of Gaussian MD can be found.
- PDB-Files
> Contains various PDB files used and generated by the project. m5_NTFS_gen1.pdb was the generated apo form of the receptor prior to any simulations.
- morph_activation.mp4
> Movie showing the movement of the receptor as it becomes activated.
